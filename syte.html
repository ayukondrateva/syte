                        <p>I have become so complete in my knowledge that it is as if I had already

a hundred trillion billion years I live on trillions and

trillions of planets like this Earth, to me this world is absolutely

is clear, and I am here looking for only one thing - peace, tranquility and

this harmony, from merging with the infinitely eternal, from contemplation

great fractal similarity and from this wonderful unity

a being, infinitely eternal, wherever you look, even deep down - endlessly

small, even upward - infinitely large, do you understand? And you are with me again

with this, go fuss further, this is your distribution, this

your path and your horizon of knowledge and sensation of your nature, it

disproportionately small compared to mine, you know? It's like I'm already

a long time ago, a very old man, immortal, or at least almost immortal,

who has been on this planet since its very inception, even when only the Sun

just formed as a star, and here is this gas and dust cloud,

behold, after the explosion of the Sun, when it flared up like a star, the beginning

to form these coacervates, planets, you know, I’m already on this Earth

as if I’ve been living for almost five billion years and know it inside and out

this whole world, and you are some kind of... I don’t care about your cars, about yours

yachts, to your apartments, there, for your benefit</p>
